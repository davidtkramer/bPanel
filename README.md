# bPanel

bPanel is a marching band management web app I built in partnership with the CSUS Marching Band. Built with jQuery and a mini MVC framework I developed in PHP.

Features include:

- Member registration form that collects email, instrument type, and other profile information
- Admin panel to view member profiles
- Uniform finder tool to determine the best-fitting uniform from inventory based on their measurements
- Uniform inventory management, tracking checkouts/check-ins
- Printing receipts for checked-out items
- Bulk emailing of band members
- Printing member rosters
